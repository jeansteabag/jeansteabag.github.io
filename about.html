                Margin Notes is a new writing collective at Yale University founded by two Yale undergraduate students Courtnie Bui YC'27 and Marissa Halagao YC'27. 
                <br> 
                Hailing from Orange County, California and O'ahu, Hawai'i respectively, they are committed to spotlighting the voices of the marginalized on Yale's campus and the greater New Haven community.
                <br>
                We mean it when we say:
                <marquee> SPOTLIGHTING STORIES OUTSIDE THE MARGINS </marquee>
                and this is the purpose of this space: to tell stories that are often overlooked and shine light on what has been previously dimmed.
                <br>
                This commitment extends to our technological space! We strive for an accessible space to access our work, and we echo that sentiment through our simple webzine, free of advertisement space or flashy visuals. 
                And, for maximum effect, we offer an "accessibility view" to ensure that all those who come across our website can use it to the fullest ability.
                <br>
