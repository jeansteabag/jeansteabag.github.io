                In 2021, 19-year-old Marissa Halagao, a Punahou School sophomore at the time, was struck by the fact 
                that her Asian studies class emphasized only Chinese and Japanese histories, even though Filipinos make 
                up the largest ethnic Asian population on Hawai’i’s islands. Moreover, Filipino students represent the 
                largest ethnic group attending Hawai’i’s public schools, with nearly 24% of students identifying as 
                Filipino.
                <br> <br>
                “I felt like we deserve to have representation, and the fact that we were not getting that in our 
                history classes, it communicated to me as a Filipino American that my history and my culture was not 
                worthy to be explored,” Halagao, now a freshman at Yale, tells Teen Vogue.
                <br> <br>
                Last year, Hawai’i made history as the first state to adopt a Filipino studies curriculum in its 
                schools. This momentous approval was the culmination of a two-year campaign led by high schoolers 
                and college students under the Filipino Curriculum Project (FCP) to integrate Filipino representation 
                into Hawai’i’s education system. But the real-life impact of this achievement goes beyond school 
                textbooks.
                <br> <br>
                After Halagao worked with her teachers to update the school’s Asian studies course with a new 
                Filipino history component, her ambitions grew to include the launch a stand-alone Filipino history 
                and culture course, conceived through the FCP, that could be taught statewide. She teamed up with 
                students at other Hawai’i schools and kicked off the initiative in February 2021.
                <br> <br>
                The FCP team now has around 26 active students working to expand the campaign to more schools. 
                Among Halagao’s earliest collaborators was Raymart Billote, a 20-year-old junior at the University 
                of Hawai’i at West O’ahu. The desire to empower younger Filipino Americans like his sister and 
                cousins, who were born in Hawai’i, motivated Billote to join FCP. “When my younger sister was born, 
                that’s when I realized, Oh, she could benefit from this initiative, because I don’t want her to grow 
                up not knowing about her Filipino side,” explains Billote, who immigrated to Hawai’i with his family 
                when he was 14.
                <br> <br>
                Beyond carving out a space for Filipino American students to learn about their heritage, the 
                initiative is an important endeavor to combat the xenophobia that some immigrant students encounter. 
                Eighteen-year-old Barnard College freshman Mariah Iris Ramo dissociated from her Filipino heritage 
                after receiving discriminatory remarks from peers about her accent and skin color. “We’re all trying 
                to decolonize our minds,” Ramo says. “I think, knowing our history through this project and just 
                through all the connections that we've been making, it was very important in helping me reconnect 
                with my identity.”
                <br> <br>
                Creating Hawai’i’s first high school-level Filipino studies curriculum, officially named the 
                Filipino History Culture course, took a lot of effort, patience, and collaboration. During the 
                process — in addition to balancing the demands of the project with school responsibilities — a 
                big challenge for students was navigating how to work with government officials and legislators 
                as young people trying to change Hawai’i’s education system. Being in spaces where grown-ups 
                typically take charge can be alienating, but the FCP’s success proves that young advocates have 
                an important role to play in advancing such reforms.
                <br> <br>
                “This is an initiative that was founded on student voice," Halagao says. "However, there was never 
                really a blueprint or a guide for us. But because this course has gotten so much recognition… it 
                shows that student voice can succeed.”
                <br> <br>
                Despite the adoption of FCP’s curriculum into Hawai’i schools, team members say there is still much 
                work to be done. Aside from an upcoming children’s books geared toward younger children, the team has 
                outreach plans to encourage their younger peers to amplify its campaign as ambassadors.
                Among its newer recruits are 14-year-old twins Lilyanne F. and Leala F. “This group has given me an 
                opportunity to learn more about my Filipino culture,” says Lilyanne. “And I want to give my peers 
                the opportunity to learn about their Filipino culture.
