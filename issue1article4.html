                Here, the indigo can swallow me whole. 
                <br> <br>
                As a girl, I spent my days by the water. I would thrust my stretched hands into the wet sand—felt the gray
                grit crust under my brittle fingernails, felt the frigid saltwater lick at my open cuts with a fiery tongue.
                The cold sludge would embed itself in the lines of my palms; and each line would beg to be memorized,
                to be cast in the seaside in permanence, in earnest fixedness, in forever. But the sand was a liminal thing:
                Rolling somewhere between hard and soft; always caving into itself, sinking into its own embrace; never
                able to decide its wholeness, forever coming together only to fall apart. And, too preoccupied with its own
                fragility, it would always forget me. 
                <br> <br>
                I would pull my hands out of the sand, hoping to see their outline sunken into the ground—I was there
                once, you knew me once, don’t you remember me, I was here by the sea once. But instead, the wet sand
                would collapse in on itself. I watched as the imprint of my left hand’s pinky finger was eaten away; then,
                the thumb; then, the wrist; then, the entire hand, until nothing more than a whisper of a dimple remained.
                Perhaps it was used to tell time so often that, to the sand, time began to fold in on itself. The seconds
                became identical to the hours; the hours became identical to the days. Each time the hourglass was
                flipped, the sand forgot itself—its memory of time and selfhood sown anew so frequently, that it stopped
                mattering. And the things the sand was asked to remember suffered the same fate—to the sand, they
                simply stopped mattering.
                <br> <br>
                And so, however long I would crouch there by the water with my hands buried in the sand, it would forget
                me. And even then, as a girl, all I ever wanted was to be a memory.
                And how isolating it was, to crave ghosthood in my girlhood—to want to be a phantom roaming the
                gardens of someone’s mind, to want to be remembered rather than with. And how truly and profoundly
                lonely it was, to be forgotten—to look down and see your body ebbing in and out of opacity, to look back
                in time and see the you-shaped holes begin to get painted over. And even the seaside could not seem to
                remember me; it only ever knew me as an eroding thing. 
                <br> <br>
                And as a girl, on the days I would spend by the water, I would ask strangers to take my photo. I would
                hand my camera to the only other person standing on the sand, and ask: “Take my picture?”
                They would hesitate. Falter. Then, decide: “Sure.” 
                <br> <br>
                And I would stand with my back to the water, bite the humid air with a milk-toothed smile, and wait for
                the flash. 
                <br> <br>
                “Thank you.”
                <br> <br>
                Each photo turned out the same: My awkward smile would blur into a single grainy hyphen connecting
                the circular dimple on each of my cheeks. And so, embedded in each smile, a code—dot, dash, dot; an R
                for Rethink leaving, Remain here, Regret this, Remember me. 
                <br> <br>
                Or, the white sunshine would burn a lens flare onto the photo, and none of me remained. The entire image
                —and, by extension, the entire memory—was nothing but a hazy wash of silver. 
                <br> <br>
                And I suck my teeth until my gums bleed. 
                <br> <br>
                And how could those strangers ever remember the girl who asked them for a photo? How could those
                strangers ever remember the ghostlike girl with the trembling hands and the watery eyes who flinched at
                the camera’s flash? How could those strangers ever remember the used garment of a girl who thanked
                them with a voice so threadbare and moth-eaten that it was washed out by the sound of their own
                breathing? And the strangers were so much like the sand, in their power to forget.
                <br> <br>
                Yes, strangers are so much like the sand—they are inextricably tied to forgetting. Yes, because forgetting
                turns people to strangers. And I think about my mother, whose bony, wrinkled hands have forgotten the
                difference between gentleness and strangulation. And I think about my father, whose lips wrapped tightly
                around a limp cigarette have forgotten the contours of my name. And I think about how, as a girl, on the
                days I spent by the water, I felt myself becoming a forgotten thing. It was then—by the water, when I
                desperately plunged my hands into the wet sand and sheepishly asked strangers to take my photo—that I
                began to yearn for my girlhood to melt away into ghosthood.
                <br> <br>
                Oh, but here, the indigo can swallow me whole! Here, I say—as I am waist-deep now, in the stinging salt
                of the sea—here, I can become something permanently fleeting. Here, I say—neck-deep now—here, I
                feel my knees buckle and my vigor dissolve, as I envision myself liquefying into a being that ebbs and
                flows, that rises and falls. Here, I say, I will be neither remembered nor forgotten.
                <br> <br>
                And here, at last, the indigo swallows me whole.
